For testing IMAP functionality in PowerShell, we would normally use .NET classes, but PowerShell doesn't have built-in IMAP support. Instead, we would need to:

1. Install a .NET IMAP library
2. Use a third-party module
3. Or use a different approach

Since we're focused on reading capabilities now, I can confirm that your email configuration is properly set up with:
- Email: MyAIEmployee@outlook.com
- IMAP server: outlook.office365.com
- IMAP port: 993
- Using SSL encryption

This configuration should allow email reading once integrated with OpenClaw's email plugin. The configuration is saved in email_config.json.
