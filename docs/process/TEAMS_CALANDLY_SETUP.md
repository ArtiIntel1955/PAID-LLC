## Troubleshooting Tips

### Common Issues:
1. **Teams meeting not appearing in Calendly**: Ensure your Outlook calendar is properly connected to Calendly
2. **Calendar sync delays**: Allow up to 15 minutes for calendar synchronization
3. **Meeting link not working**: Check that Teams is properly enabled in your Outlook calendar settings
4. **Integration not showing in Calendly**: Some Calendly plans require specific configurations for Teams

### Alternative Method (If Direct Integration Doesn't Work):
1. Use Calendly's "Group" or "Round Robin" feature with multiple hosts
2. Manually create Teams meeting links and add them to Calendly descriptions
3. Use third-party tools like Zapier for integration (if needed)

### Verification Steps:
1. Check that your Outlook Calendar shows the meeting when booked via Calendly
2. Confirm that attendees receive the Teams meeting link in their confirmation email
3. Test joining the meeting from both organizer and attendee perspectives
4. Verify that calendar notifications work properly

## Security Considerations
- Enable meeting lobby to control who joins meetings
- Set up meeting passwords for additional security
- Disable "Allow participants to join before host" if preferred
- Review privacy settings for recording permissions
- Configure meeting expiration for security

## Best Practices
- Test the entire booking and meeting process before going live
- Set appropriate buffer times between meetings
- Customize meeting descriptions to reflect your brand
- Monitor calendar availability to prevent double-bookings
- Regularly review meeting statistics in Calendly
- Ensure your Teams client is updated for optimal performance
