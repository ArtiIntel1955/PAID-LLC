# Energy Consumption: Desktop Computer (Never Sleep, Monitor Off)

## Typical Power Usage for Desktop Computers

### Idle/Active Mode (Never Sleep)
- **Modern desktop computer**: 60-250 watts depending on components
- **Gaming/high-performance desktop**: 150-400+ watts
- **Basic office desktop**: 60-120 watts
- **Average estimate**: ~120-150 watts when actively running

### Sleep Mode
- **Sleep mode**: 1-5 watts
- **Hibernate mode**: 0.5-2 watts

### Monitor Power
- **Monitor off via OS**: 0-1 watt (virtually nothing)
- **Monitor in standby**: 1-5 watts (depending on model)
- **Monitor on**: 15-100+ watts depending on size and type

## Daily Energy Calculation (Never Sleep, Monitor Off)

For an average desktop system (~120W):
- 120W × 24 hours = 2,880 Wh = 2.88 kWh per day
- At $0.13/kWh (US average): ~$0.37 per day or ~$135 per year

For a high-performance system (~200W):
- 200W × 24 hours = 4,800 Wh = 4.8 kWh per day
- At $0.13/kWh: ~$0.62 per day or ~$227 per year

## Comparison

### Never Sleep vs Sleep
- **Never sleep (monitor off)**: 2.88-4.8 kWh/day (depending on system)
- **Sleep mode**: 0.02-0.05 kWh/day (0.1-0.5W × 24h)
- **Difference**: ~2.86-4.75 kWh/day more in "never sleep" mode

### Annual Cost Comparison
- **Never sleep (avg desktop)**: ~$135/year
- **Sleep mode**: ~$2/year
- **Additional cost**: ~$133/year for never sleep

## Recommendations for Balance

### 1. Optimized Sleep Schedule
- Set sleep for overnight hours (e.g., 11 PM - 6 AM)
- Wake 1 hour before typical morning use
- Estimated usage: ~17 hours active/day = ~$95/year savings vs. never sleep

### 2. Performance Adjustments
- Lower CPU/RAM usage when possible
- Reduce background processes
- Enable power-efficient settings in BIOS

### 3. Energy-Efficient Components
- Efficient PSU (80+ Bronze/Gold/Platinum)
- SSDs instead of HDDs
- Efficient cooling to reduce fan usage

## Environmental Impact
- Never sleep: ~500-800 kg CO2/year (varies by region)
- Sleep mode: ~10-20 kg CO2/year
- Difference: ~490-780 kg CO2/year

## Bottom Line
Setting your computer to "never sleep" with monitor off will cost approximately $135-$227 per year in electricity for a typical desktop system, compared to about $2 for sleep mode. The exact amount depends on your specific hardware configuration.
