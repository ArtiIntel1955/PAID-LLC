## PAID-LLC Download System Implementation

Today I worked on creating a complete download and security system for PAID-LLC digital products that integrates with Stripe for payment verification.

### Completed Components:
1. GitHub sync setup instructions (GITHUB_SETUP.md)
2. Complete download system with:
   - Express.js server (server.js)
   - SQLite database for purchase records (database.js)
   - Authentication middleware (auth.js)
   - Stripe webhook handler (stripe-webhook.js)
   - Package.json with dependencies
   - Environment variables template (.env.example)
3. Setup instructions (SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
4. Frontend with product showcase and Stripe integration
5. Success page with download functionality

### Key Features Implemented:
- Secure download tokens that expire after 30 days
- Max 5 downloads per token
- Stripe webhook integration for payment verification
- Database storage of purchase records
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Webhook signature verification
- Token-based authentication

### Files Created:
- GITHUB_SETUP.md
- download_system/README.md
- download_system/server.js
- download_system/database.js
- download_system/auth.js
- download_system/stripe-webhook.js
- download_system/package.json
- download_system/.env.example
- SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- download_system/public/index.html
- download_system/public/success.html

### Next Steps Needed:
1. Deploy the server to a hosting platform
2. Configure Stripe with webhook endpoint
3. Set up environment variables with real keys
4. Test the complete purchase and download flow
5. Add additional security measures as needed

The system is ready for deployment and provides a complete solution for selling digital products with secure download access tied to Stripe payment verification.
