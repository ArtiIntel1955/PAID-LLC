## API Strategy Decision - February 2, 2026
- DECISION: Only use free API services to avoid any costs
- If free tier limits are reached, find alternative free services
- If free tier limits are reached, wait for tokens to refresh according to free plan guidelines
- Current implementation uses only free services (DuckDuckGo, local Whisper, etc.)
- No paid API integrations to be activated without explicit consent
- Prioritize cost-free alternatives for all functionality
